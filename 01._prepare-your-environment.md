# I. Prepare your environment

When developing in NodeJS, it is always a good practice to create a virtual
environment to develop a new project. This way, your dependencies versions will
not conflict with other tools/projects that you are using/working on.

We highly recommend to use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to
manage your environments. The easiest way to install on Linux is
presented [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/). If you are
comfortable with other ways to install NodeJS and NPM, feel free to use them.

In this section, we will describe you how to install NodeJS and
the NPM packages needed to follow the tutorial.

## I.1. Install NodeJS

### On Debian systems (Ubuntu, Elementary OS...)

```bash
# install NodeJS
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
# fix any problem with NPM permissions
mkdir -p $HOME/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '$HOME/.npm-global'
export PATH=$HOME/.npm-global/bin:$PATH
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> $HOME/.bashrc
# update npm
npm install -g npm
```

## I.2. Setup your project environment

```bash
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
npm install request fs
```

The last line will create:

- a folder `node_modules` where the packages are installed (mustn't be git commited)
- a file `package-lock.json` which keeps in memory all the package versions (must be git commited)

**Note:** If you want to use the examples written in this repository, execute `cd examples; npm install`. It will install the dependencies because the folder already contains the `package-lock.json` required.
