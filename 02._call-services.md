# II. Call services

## II.1. List avaible services

The curl command is:

```bash
curl \
    -H "User-Token: ${username}" \
    -H "Accept-Token: ${password}" \
    https://demo.noos.cloud:9001/available_services
```

The output is in JSON and is a bit ugly in the terminal.
If you have installed python in your computer, you
can add ` | python -m json.tool` to beautify the JSON received.

Another solution is to `npm install -g prettyjson` and do the same:
` | prettyjson`

## II.2. Call services

### II.2.a Basic example

We currently do not support the service calling from the web browser. If you want to query the platform using Javascript, you have to do it in a NodeJS script.

Here is the list of computer vision services that we offer:

- face_recognition
- face_detection
- human_detection
- qr_recognition
- age_detection
- gender_detection
- face_expression

All this services can be called with POST request, the form must be of type `multipart-data`
and contain a binary image field.

An example for face_detection would be in bash:

```bash
curl \
    -H "User-Token: ${username}" \
    -H "Accept-Token: ${password}" \
    -F "filename=@../data/face.jpg" \
    https://demo.noos.cloud:9001/face_detection
```

If we want to translate this to Javascript, you have an example in
`examples/basic_example/basic_example.js`.

To make it work, please create a file ".noos_credentials" with on the first line your username and your password on the second.

### II.2.b Advanced example

To see how to call all the different services of the platform, please the check the advanced example contained in `examples/advanced_example`.
