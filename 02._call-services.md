# II. Call services

## II.1. List avaible services

The curl command is:

```bash
curl \
    -H "User-Token: ${username}" \
    -H "Accept-Token: ${password}" \
    https://demo.noos.cloud:9001/available_services
```

The output is in JSON and is a bit ugly in the terminal.
If you have installed python in your computer, you
can add ` | python -m json.tool` to beautify the JSON received.

Another solution is to `npm install -g prettyjson` and do the same:
` | prettyjson`

## II.2. Call services

### II.2.a Basic example

**Note**
We support a call done from the web browser. However, the web browser keeps the connection open until
the browser it is closed, having the following inconvenience: If the browser doesn't send messages with the platform for more than 60 seconds,
the server close the connection but the browser keep that connection open instead of creating a new one. 
Therefore, the next time you try to do a call from the browser, the server is not going to allow that communication.
You have to close the window with your program and open it again.

Here is the list of computer vision services that we offer:

- face_recognition
- face_detection
- human_detection
- qr_recognition
- age_detection
- gender_detection
- face_expression

All this services can be called with POST request, the form must be of type `multipart-data`
and contain a binary image field.

An example for face_detection would be in bash:

```bash
curl \
    -H "User-Token: ${username}" \
    -H "Accept-Token: ${password}" \
    -F "filename=@../data/face.jpg" \
    https://demo.noos.cloud:9001/face_detection
```

If we want to translate this to Javascript, you have an example in
`examples/basic_example/basic_example.js`.

To make it work, please create a file ".noos_credentials" with on the first line your username and your password on the second.
